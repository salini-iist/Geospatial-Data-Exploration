# Geospatial-Data-Exploration-
Geospatial Data Exploration Task for Remote Sensing Internship 2023
Task: Use a provided Sentinel-2 data cube with only raw bands, then post-process
a new layer of NDVI to achieve a map and time series visualization
Deliverables:
# 1. A Jupyter notebook from start to finish, opening, exploring, visualizing, and
modifying the geospatial data, specifically including the following:
a. Calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
over the entire AOI for each date given in the data cube and added as
a separate data layer in the same provided data cube
b. A visual RGB image of one date
c. Distribution (histogram) of NDVI pixels
d. Time series of NDVI averaged over the AOI
# 2. A brief description of your interpretation of the spatial distribution and
evolution of the NDVI/vegetation
# 3. A visualization of NDVI (colormap here) clipped to the provided sub-AOI
